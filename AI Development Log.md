# **AI Development Log**

### **Methodological Note on Transparency**

This document is an integral part of the Supplementary Material and serves the purpose of methodological transparency. It documents the co-creative research process that led to the development of the present framework. Parts of the conceptual development, formalisation, and literature research were carried out in an iterative dialogue between the human author and generative AI systems (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity AI). This log presents selected key interactions to make the genesis of the ideas traceable and to provide an example of a hybrid human-AI research paradigm.

### **Initial Debate with ChatGPT (Topic Finding and Political Context)**

*Initial dialogue on geopolitical scenarios in the semiconductor sector, which led to the core question of how technological independence could be achieved through radically new chip architectures.*

**Speakers:**

* User: Hans Mund (Author)  
* AI: ChatGPT

**Excerpt from the dialogue:**

**User:** My guess: China gets Taiwan, and in return, the USA gets cheaper chips from TSMC under Chinese leadership for years to come.

**ChatGPT:** In short: Your source is correct ‚Äì and your guess is extremely unlikely...

A detailed geopolitical and technological analysis followed...

**User:** Chinese researchers are currently pursuing several radically new approaches in chip development... 2D materials... bismuth basis...

**ChatGPT:** I like your line of thought ("China is changing the game instead of bending the rules") ‚Äî let's sharpen it: What is confirmed, what is promising, and what is (still) wishful thinking/PR?

### **Dialogue with Gemini (Conceptualisation of the Cymatic Processor)**

*After the initial debate, the focus shifted to developing an entirely new computer architecture, one that was independent of geopolitical constraints. In this dialogue, the core idea of the Cymatic Processor was born and refined.*

**Speakers:**

* User: Hans Mund (Author)  
* AI: Gemini as "Developer MudOS"

**Excerpt from the dialogue:**

**User:** What if Chinese developments were combined with current technologies?

**Gemini:** Exciting question ü§ù ‚Äî "combined" is possible, and that's where the real magic could lie. Four practicable hybrid recipes...

**User:** Then I'll think about what a chip would look like, one that consists of a nanometer-high, one-centimetre-wide, and one-centimetre-long, ultra-folded quasi-fluid metallurgical molecular mix.

**Gemini:** Your vision of an "ultra-folded quasi-fluid metallurgical molecular mix" is the logical and radical consequence of this development. It's no longer a chip in the classical sense... Let's call it the "Cymatic Processor"...

### **Research and Validation with Perplexity & Consensus**

*To provide a scientific foundation for the concept, targeted research was conducted to support the theoretical building blocks (slime mold models, Floquet theory, etc.) with current, verifiable research. The key publications identified here serve as the basis for the references cited in the main document.*

### **Final Polishing and Refinement (Dialogue with Gemini)**

*Following a comprehensive review of the near-final manuscript, the last remaining points were addressed to elevate the paper to submission-ready quality.*

**Speakers:**

* User: Hans Mund (Author)  
* AI: Gemini

**Summary of the final iteration:**

* **Quantitative Validation:** The importance of the quantitative analysis (Figure 4\) was further emphasized in the discussion section (4.3) to explicitly frame it as the transition from a qualitative proof to a hard, quantitative validation of the "winner-takes-it-all" effect.  
* **Visual Clarity:** The Python script for figure generation was updated to visually enhance Figure 3\. The "frozen" edge is now rendered with a more vibrant color and increased line thickness to ensure its prominence, directly addressing the feedback on visual implementation.  
* **Conceptual Sharpening:** The introduction (Section 1.4) was revised to draw a sharper, more explicit distinction between the proposed morphogenetic framework and traditional neuromorphic systems, focusing on the concept of dynamic topology versus fixed topology with adjustable weights.

*This log is an incomplete but representative selection of key interactions. It is intended to illustrate the iterative and dialogic character of the research process.*
